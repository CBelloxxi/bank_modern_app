It encompasses all modern UX Practices, follows a stringent and well organised File Structure, uses React Functional components to create reusable card components and tailwindcss for all styling.

<h2>Improve or Change</h2>
The next steps to continue building this into a fully fledged app would be to build a back end application in which you can sign up, sign-in and create table bookings for your parties, integrate a Map API - either mapbox or google maps to present a location for the restaurant and link the form to an onClick method that submits the form to a google sheet file for reference to the business to use as a customer database and as a small database.
