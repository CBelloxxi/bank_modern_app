<h1> HooBank Modern Bank App </h1>
<p> This is the HooBank Modern Bank App built with a Modern UI/UX using Vite, React JS and Tailwind CSS. It encompasses all modern UX Practices, follows a stringent and well-organised File Structure, uses React Functional components to create reusable card components and tailwindcss for all styling, Vite has been used as the bundler for this build. Netlify has also been used for free hosting. </p>

<h2>Improve or Change</h2>
The next steps to continue building this into a fully fledged app would be to build a back end application in which you can sign up, sign-in and potentially use 2FA for authentication to then be able to go into a customer HooBank account and also build an admin panel to monitor account usage, integrate a Map API - either mapbox or google maps to present a location for the nearest HooBank branch (if it is a physical store).
